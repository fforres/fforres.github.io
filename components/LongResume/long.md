### üëã, I'm fforres

(people also know me as **Felipe**)

I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/fforres) by choice, an educator at heart ‚ù§Ô∏è. I'm very passionate about software communities. A [Chilean](https://www.nomadasaurus.com/photos-of-chile/) living in San Francisco, CA.

More than anything I enjoy solving problems using technology, I'm the kind of person that gets bored without a challenge or a cool proyect. I used to work for [Groupon](https://groupon.com), [AxiomZen](https://axiomzen.co) and [Segment](https://segment.io). Nowadays I work @ [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) trying to help the world and making all sorts of cool and geek things using [JS](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) (and [Python](https://www.python.org/)).

I like working with interesting people, learning, teaching and more importantly, being able to communicate it, that's why I run the [JSMeetups](https://www.meetup.com/NodersJS/) in Santiago, the [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/santiago/) Santiago events, why I started [Noders](https://www.noders.com/), [Noders.FM](https://anchor.fm/noderscast), [Noders.live](https://noders.live), [JSConf Chile](https://jsconf.cl), and why we created a non-profit called [JavascriptChile](https://jschile.org/).

(I also enjoy speaking, giving talks and presentations!)

On my free time I usually teach JS, I'm learning how to ride my Longboard, hike whenever I can, cook, and sometimes post on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fforres) or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fforr.es).

I've worked at various startups and with very interesting people, you can read more on my [linkedin profile](https://cl.linkedin.com/in/fforres) or by looking [onto my cv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cgYCa2D1-x6jN5hOX8CaEcQP2DdwdktS/view?usp=sharing).

If you have any questions, feedback or just want to say hi, you feel free to send me one of those [electronic mails](mailto:hi@fforr.es?subject=üëã).

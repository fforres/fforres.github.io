### üëã, I'm fforres

(people also know me as **Felipe**)

I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/fforres) by choice, an educator at heart ‚ù§Ô∏è. I'm very passionate about software communities. A [Chilean](https://www.nomadasaurus.com/photos-of-chile/) living in San Francisco, CA.

More than anything I enjoy solving problems using technology, (I love JavaScript and the Web Ecosystem). I'm the kind of person that gets bored without a challenge or a cool proyect. I used to work for [Groupon](https://groupon.com), [AxiomZen](https://axiomzen.co), [Segment](https://segment.io), [Brex](https://brex.com) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), now I'm building my own thing @ [Skyward.ai](https://skyward.ai/). 

I like working with interesting people, learning, teaching and more importantly, being able to communicate it, that's why I run the [JSMeetups](https://www.meetup.com/NodersJS/) in Santiago, why I started [Noders](https://www.noders.com/), [Noders.FM](https://anchor.fm/noderscast), [Noders.live](https://noders.live), [JSConf Chile](https://jsconf.cl), and why we created a non-profit called [JavascriptChile](https://jschile.org/) as well as [CommunityOS](https://communityos.io/).


On my free time I usually mentor folks and do what I can to teach. I hang out with my incredible [wife](https://twitter.com/_pilliin_) and my beautiful cats, and sometimes post on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fforres).

I've worked at various startups and with very interesting people, you can read more on my [linkedin profile](https://cl.linkedin.com/in/fforres) or by looking [onto my cv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cgYCa2D1-x6jN5hOX8CaEcQP2DdwdktS/view?usp=sharing).

If you have any questions, feedback or just want to say hi, you feel free to send me one of those [electronic mails](mailto:hi@fforr.es?subject=üëã).

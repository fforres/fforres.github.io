### üëã, I'm fforres

(people also know me as **Felipe**)

I'm a [software engineer](https://github.com/fforres) by choice, an educator at heart ‚ù§Ô∏è. I'm very passionate about software communities. A [Chilean](https://www.nomadasaurus.com/photos-of-chile/) living in SFO.

More than anything I enjoy solving problems using technology, I'm the kind of person that gets bored without a challenge or a cool proyect. I used to work for [Groupon](https://groupon.com) and [AxiomZen](http://axiomzen.co). Nowadays I work @ [Segment](https://segment.com/) making all sorts of cool and geek things using JS!

I like working with interesting people, learning, teaching and being able to communicate that, that's why I run the [JSMeetups](https://www.meetup.com/NodersJS/) in Santiago, the [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/santiago/) Santiago events, and why I started [Noders](https://www.noders.com/).

(I also enjoy speaking, giving talks and presentations.)

On my free time I usually teach JS, I'm learning how to ride my Longboard, hike whenever I can, and sometimes post on [twitter](https://twitter.com/fforres) or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/fforr.es).

I've worked at various startups and with very interesting people, you can read more on my [linkedin profile](https://cl.linkedin.com/in/fforres) or by looking [onto my cv](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zyPmrxMJmP61lOdVBh3kbQ8h_U56103bvQMx8NcJFlU/edit?usp=sharing).

If you have any questions, feedback or just want to say hi, you can send me one of those [electronic emails](mailto:felipe.torressepulveda@gmail.com?subject=üëã).
